## Installation

### From Source

#### Install a Patched Version of PyTorch

```bash
bash patches/build_pytorch_w_patch.sh
```

This will compile and install a patched version of PyTorch (based on v2.2.1_rc3).
The patch code can be found here: [PyTorch-Patch](patches/patched_pytorch_v2.2.1_rc3.patch)

#### Install a Patched Version of TorchDistX

```bash
bash patches/build_torchdistX_w_patch.sh
```

This will compile and install a patched version of TorchdistX (based on its master).
